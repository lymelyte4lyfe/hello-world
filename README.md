# hello-world
Me getting the hang of this git-hub website.

I'm very new to this website.
I look forward to increasing my working knowledge of writing code.
I would like to emphasize on python and javascript.
So far I have learned a little about those two languages
I have learned about those languages on code academy.
My new adventure in learning code begins.
